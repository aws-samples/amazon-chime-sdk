## Amazon Chime SDK Samples

The Amazon Chime SDK is a set of real-time communications components that developers can use to quickly add messaging, audio, video, and screen sharing capabilities to their web or mobile applications. Developers can leverage the same communication infrastructure and services that power Amazon Chime, an online meetings service from AWS, and deliver engaging experiences in their applications.

This repository contains samples intended to demonstrate different use cases for the Amazon Chime SDK. Each sample is accompanied by its own set of instructions to get you started.
